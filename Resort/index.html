//Resort Website
You are hired by an investor to create a website for a private island resort that they are building.

Your website should have:

A main home page
Pages for:
accommodations
activities
travel arrangements
contact information
pictures, etc.
The investor doesn't know exactly what style they want for the website, so they have asked you 
to use your best judgement and provide them with at least two options for styling so they can 
make their decision later.

Make a branch for each style and when you are done, call a teacher over so that the "investor" 
can see their options and decide which style they would prefer. Once the "investor" (your TM) 
has made their selection, merge that branch into master.

Make sure you have been making commits throughout building this project and make a gh-pagesbranch 
to display it on GitHub Pages. And don't forget your README!
Further Exploration
If you and your partner finish all activities for the day with time to spare, make a website 
for your favorite restaurant. Include a page to display the menu, a page with contact information 
and hours, and a homepage describing the cuisine, or restaurant's history. Add styles using CSS, 
and publish the site on GitHub Pages.
